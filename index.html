            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am a software engineer, interested in Machine Learning and AI. Currently I work as an ML Engineer at 
                <a href="https://vernacular.ai">Vernacular.ai</a>, building applications using ML for 
                Conversational AI and Spoken Language Understanding.
                <br><br>
                I have an affinity towards the research aspects of Machine Learning. My research experience so far has come 
                from my time working as a research assistant in Image and Video Processing Lab 
                (<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/drsuvendurup/home">Prof. Suvendu Rup</a>, IIIT Bhubaneswar)
                and <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/">Robotics Research Center</a> 
                (Prof. K Madhava Krishna, IIIT Hyderabad).
                <br><br>
                Outside computer science, I enjoy heavy metal music, reading scifi and fantasy, anime, football and 
                professional wrestling. I am always happy to connect with people interested in disussing any of these
                topics or anything around Machine Learning. You can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himansu-didwania/">LinkedIn</a> 
                or via <a href="mailto:hdidwania1997@gmail.com">e-mail</a>. You can also find my projects on 
                my <a href="https://github.com/hdidwania">GitHub</a>.
