            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Himansu Didwania, a software engineer interested in Machine Learning and AI. Currently I work
                as an ML Engineer at <a href="https://skit.ai">Skit</a>, where I work on using Spoken Language Understanding
                for building voice bots. I completed B.Tech from IIIT Bhubaneswar in 2020.
                <br><br>
                I like to explore and work upon the research aspects of Machine Learning. During my undergrad, I have 
                worked as research assistant in Image and Video Processing Lab, IIIT Bhubaneswar and 
                <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/">Robotics Research Center</a>, IIIT Hyderabad. Although I am
                still in the phase of exploring Machine Learning, my current interests broadly revolve around Generative 
                Models and Representation Learning.
                <br><br>
                When not working on ML, I like to study maths and algorithms. I am working on some projects to fill
                my empty <a href="https://github.com/hdidwania">GitHub</a> profile. Outside programming and computer science,
                I enjoy heavy metal music, for which I am trying to learn playing guitar (and terribly so). I like to 
                read fiction- mostly scifi and fantasy genres. I am also an avid fan of Football and Professional Wrestling.
                <br><br>
                I can be reached via <a href="mailto:hdidwania1997@gmail.com">e-mail</a> or 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himansu-didwania/">LinkedIn</a>. For my programming projects, you
