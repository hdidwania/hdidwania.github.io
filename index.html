            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Himansu Didwania, a developer interested in Machine Learning and AI. Currently I work
                as an ML Engineer at <a href="https://skit.ai">Skit</a>, where I build voicebots and work on
                Spoken Language Understanding. I completed B.Tech from IIIT Bhubaneswar in 2020.
                <br><br>
                I am fascinated by Deep Learning and aspire to pursue research in the field. During my undergrad, 
                I have worked as research assistant in Image and Video Processing Lab, IIIT Bhubaneswar and 
                <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/">Robotics Research Center</a>, IIIT Hyderabad. 
                Although I am still in the phase of exploring Machine Learning, my current interests broadly revolve 
                around Generative Models and Representation Learning. 
                <br><br>
                Outside programming and computer science, I enjoy heavy metal music, and as a metalhead I am trying to 
                learn guitar (and terribly so). I like to read fiction- mostly scifi and fantasy genres. 
                I am also an avid fan of Football and Professional Wrestling.
                <br><br>
                I can be reached via <a href="mailto:hdidwania1997@gmail.com">e-mail</a> or 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himansu-didwania/">LinkedIn</a>. I maintain my programming projects
                on <a href="https://github.com/hdidwania">GitHub</a>, which is distressingly outdated. Though I am working
                on some personal projects and will start filling it soon.
