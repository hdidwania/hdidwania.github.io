            <div id="about">
                <p>
                    I am a programmer with interests revolving around Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general.
                    I don't think I have been able to find a particular area or problem statement as my focus. Afterall the field is so huge,
                    the possibilities large and applications numerous (exciting!!). So currently my goal is to explore the field from both theoretical and 
                    practical perspectives, working on different problems. Exploration aside, I like to keep working on the foundations
                    by studying maths and theoretical ML. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, I am a part of <a href="https://vernacular.ai/">Vernacular.ai</a> as an ML Solutions Engineer. Excited to be a part
                    of this amazing team and explore the applications of AI in speech and language technologies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I completed my Bachelors from IIIT Bhubaneswar (2016-20). Much of my prior experience has come from working in academic research. 
                    I have worked under Prof. Suvendu Rup at Image and Video Processing Lab, IIIT Bhubaneswar, and Prof. K Madhava Krishna
                    at <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/">RRC</a>, IIIT Hyderabad.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Outside programming and ML, I am a huge fan of metal and rock music and a novice guitarist. I spend time
                    playing games, reading fiction and watching football and professional wresting.
                </p>

                <p>
