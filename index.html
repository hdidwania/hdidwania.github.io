            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Himansu Didwania - a developer, football fan, metalhead, and 
                <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere">Cosmere</a> nerd.
                <br>
                Currently, I work in the Machine Learning team at <a href="https://ai4bharat.org/">AI4Bharat</a>,
                working on some exciting research problems in the domains of speech and NLP. Prior to this, I worked as 
                an ML Engineer at <a href="https://skit.ai">Skit.ai</a>. Beyond these, I made an unsuccessful attempt
                to build <a href="https://www.dreamscale.co.in/">Dreamscale AI</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                I enjoy working on challenging ML problems and have been inclined towards approaching problems from research
                perspectives. During my undergrad, I worked as a research assistant in the Image and Video Processing Lab, 
                at IIIT Bhubaneswar and <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/">Robotics Research Center</a>, at IIIT Hyderabad.
                <br><br>
                I am also interested in entrepreneurship and want to build a startup of my own, and solve some challenging problems 
                which can impact many.
                <br><br>
                I will be pleased to connect with you for a discussion on Machine Learning, Research, Startups, Football, or anything
                else. I am actively looking out for collaborations on ML projects and startup ideas and would love to engage with you
                on these. I can be reached via <a href="mailto:hdidwania1997@gmail.com">e-mail</a> or 
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himansu-didwania/">LinkedIn</a>. I maintain my programming projects
                on <a href="https://github.com/hdidwania">GitHub</a>, though it is distressingly outdated.
