            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Himansu Didwania - a passionate developer, football fan, metalhead, and <a href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere">Cosmere</a> nerd.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, I am a part of the Machine Learning team at <a href="https://ai4bharat.org/">AI4Bharat</a>, where I am working on some exciting research problems in the domains of speech and NLP. Before this, I was an ML Engineer at <a href="https://skit.ai">Skit.ai</a>. I also started a venture called <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dreamscaleai/">Dreamscale AI</a>, aiming to tackle some ambitious challenges with AI, but unfortunately, it didn't take off.
                <br>
                <br>
                I love working on challenging ML problems, and my natural inclination is to approach them from a research perspective. During my undergrad studies, I was a research assistant in the Image and Video Processing Lab at IIIT Bhubaneswar and the <a href="https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/">Robotics Research Center</a> at IIIT Hyderabad.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am also interested in entrepreneurship and aspire to create a startup that solves real-world challenges. I am always on the lookout for interesting collaborations on ML projects and startup ideas.
                <br>
                <br>
                Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/himansu-didwania/">LinkedIn</a> or via <a href="mailto:hdidwania1997@gmail.com">e-mail</a>. I also maintain my programming projects on <a href="https://github.com/hdidwania">GitHub</a>, although I must admit that it's not always updated as frequently as I'd like. Let's chat about Machine Learning, Research, Startups, Football, or anything else that interests you.
